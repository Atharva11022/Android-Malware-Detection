# Android Malware Detection System

The Android Malware Detection System identifies malicious Android applications using advanced machine learning techniques. Key components include:

- **Android App**: Analyzes applications for malware based on attributes like package name, permissions, and features.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Trains and predicts malware presence.
- **Data Processor**: Loads and preprocesses data for analysis.

## Use Case Overview

Users upload APK files, and the system performs:

1. **Static Analysis**: Examines APK structure without execution.
2. **Dynamic Analysis**: Executes APK in a controlled environment to monitor behavior.

A report is generated, notifying users of detected malicious activity.

## Data Flow

1. **Client**: User uploads an APK file.
2. **Server**: Analyzes APK with Androguard, extracts features, and checks hash values.
3. **Database Check**: Matches known malware hashes.
4. **Machine Learning Model**: Classifies unmatched APKs as malicious or benign.

This combines signature-based and behavior-based detection.

## Technologies Used

- **Androguard**: Feature extraction.
- **Random Forest**: Primary model.
- **Flutter**: User interface.
- **FastAPI**: APIs.
- **Python**: Programming language.
- **MongoDB**: Data storage.
- **DroidBox**: Dynamic analysis.
- **Google Colab**: Model training.

## Implementation

The system integrates static and dynamic analysis, using Androguard and Random Forest. Flutter develops the UI, FastAPI builds APIs, and MongoDB stores data. DroidBox conducts dynamic analysis, with training in Google Colab.

## Results and Impact

High accuracy and low false positives ensure reliable malware detection. The system enhances security, protects user data, and fosters trust within the Android ecosystem through regular updates and efficient resource management.
